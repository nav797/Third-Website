<h1>Products Filtering UI</h1>

Welcome to the Products Filtering UI Project!

This is a responsive product page that allows users to filter products based on selected categories and their search input. This project marks my first significant implementation of JavaScript, and I’m thrilled with what I was able to achieve.

I was excited to dive into JavaScript and enjoyed the process of bringing this project to life. I'm eager to continue learning and growing my skills so I can create even more with JavaScript in the future.
