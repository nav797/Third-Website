<h1>Products Filtering UI</h1>

Welcome to the Products Filtering UI Project!

This is a responsive product page that allows users to filter products based on selected categories and their search input. This project marks my first significant implementation of JavaScript, and Iâ€™m thrilled with what I was able to achieve.

I was excited to dive into JavaScript and enjoyed the process of bringing this project to life. I'm eager to continue learning and growing my skills so I can create even more with JavaScript in the future.
